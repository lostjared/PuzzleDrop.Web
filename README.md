WebAssembly Game Demo Instructions:

Controls:
* Move Blocks: Navigate the blocks horizontally using the Left and Right Arrow keys.
* Shift Colors: Change the colors of the blocks by pressing the Up Arrow key.
* Rotate Blocks: Adjust the orientation of the blocks with the Spacebar.

Gameplay:

Your task is to rearrange the blocks so that they form a sequence of 3-2-1 or 1-2-3 in the same color, aligning them either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Pay attention to the flashing block; it's a wildcard that can substitute for any number or color in your sequence. Your objective is to keep clearing blocks to progress through the levels, aiming to reach level 7.
